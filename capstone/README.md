# Plant Seedlings Classification

This project is a proposed solution to Kaggle Competition - Plant Seedlings Classification â€“ Determine the species of a seedling from an image. The project problem and dataset are taken directly from Kaggle website.

In this project, I plan to build and train a Convolution Neural Network model to classify an image into 12 plant seedlings:
- Black-grass
- Charlock
- Cleavers
- Common Chickweed
-	Common wheat
-	Fat Hen
-	Loose Silky-bent
-	Maize
-	Scentless Mayweed
-	Shepherds Purse
-	Small-flowered Cranesbill
-	Sugar beet

Following steps will be performed to find a possible solution:
-	Data pre-processing (may include different techniques to visualize the data, image augmentation etc.)
-	Creation of simple Convolution Neural Network (from scratch)
-	Creation of Convolution Neural Network (using transfer learning)
-	Measure performance of both the models.

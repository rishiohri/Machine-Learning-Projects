# Predicting Boston Housing Prices
This was my first project. In this project, I evaluated the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts.The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. 

In this project I learned and applied the following:
- Data Exploration 
  - Calculated minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation using NumPy.
  - Developed intutive understanding for feature observation
- Performance Model
  - Defined performance metrics i.e. R2 score using sklearn.metrics
  - Shuffle and split test and training data using sklearn.cross_validation
  - Developed a good understanding of various learning curves
  - Learnt Bias-Variance Tradeoff and difference between high bias(underfit) and high variance(overfit)
- Evaluating Performance
  - Applied Grid Search technique
  - Discussed k-fold cross validation
  - Found an optimal model
- Discussed Sensitivity and Applicability of the model.

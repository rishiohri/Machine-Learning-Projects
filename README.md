# Machine-Learning-Projects
### The repository shows the projects completed by me as a part of *Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree* program.

- **Predicting Boston Housing Prices** – Used scikit learn and regression to analyze a real dataset of housing prices in Boston.
- **Finding Donors for CharityML** - Built a classification model to identify the best potential donors for a charity.
- **Creating Customer Segments** – Applied unsupervised learning techniques to extract valuable information from dataset of customers for a company.
- **Dog Breed Classifier** – Built a convolution neural network from scratch and also applied transfer learning using Keras to recognize dog breeds from images. 
- **Teach a Quadcopter how to fly** -  Built a task to take-off a quadcopter and created a DDPG agent to perform that task.

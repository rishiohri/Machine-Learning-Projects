- [X] **_Predicting Boston Housing Prices_** – Used scikit learn and regression to analyze a real dataset of housing prices in Boston.
- [X] **_Finding Donors for CharityML_** - Built a classification model to identify the best potential donors for a charity.
- [X] **_Creating Customer Segments_** – Applied unsupervised learning techniques to extract valuable information from dataset of customers for a company.
- [X] **_Dog Breed Classifier_** – Built a convolution neural network from scratch and also applied transfer learning using Keras to recognize dog breeds from images. 
- [ ] **_Teach a Quadcopter how to fly_** -  Applying deep reinforcement learning to build a task to take-off a quadcopter and training a DDPG agent to perform that task. 
- [ ] **_Capstone-Plant Seedlings Classification_** -  Building a convolution neural network from scratch and also use transfer learning to recognize seedlings from their images.

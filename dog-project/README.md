# Dog Breed Classifier 
## Using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)

In this project, I learnt how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the dog's breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
Following steps were performed in the project:
- Step 0: Import Datasets
- Step 1: Detect Humans
- Step 2: Detect Dogs
- Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
- Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
- Step 6: Write a final algorithm
- Step 7: Test the algorithm

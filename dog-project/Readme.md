# Dog Breed Classifier Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the Machine Learning Nanodegree! In this project, I learnt how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
